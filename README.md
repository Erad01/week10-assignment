when creating a user management system using supabase you will need to set up a Next.js app and install the client library of supabase with npm install @supabase/supabase-js which allows your javascript or typescript code to interact with your Supabase backend directly. providing the functions of connecting to your supabase project, Querying your database (CRUD operations), what we are using it for Managing users (sign up, sign in, sign out), Listening to real-time updates and Uploading and downloading files from Supabase Storage

then you will need to install supabase's client library for server-side rendering (SSR) with npm install @supabase/ssr, while normally, youâ€™d use @supabase/supabase-js (the regular client) to talk to your Supabase backend. However, in SSR environments, it allows you to be more complex with what you can do as you may need to share authentication state between server and client (cookies, sessions),what we will be using it for is to run Supabase queries securely on the server (so secrets arenâ€™t exposed), it also allows you to hydrate the Supabase client on the browser after the page loads.

@supabase/ssr helps handle those scenarios automatically.
